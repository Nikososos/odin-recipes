    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This butter chicken recipe, or chicken makhani, is one of my favorite Indian dishes.<br> 
        It features a full-flavored sauce that complements the chicken well. 
        It can be made as<br> mild or spicy as you wish by adjusting the cayenne. 
        Serve with basmati rice and naan bread.</p>
