    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These peanut butter oatmeal cookies are a nice change of pace from the<br> usual peanut butter 
        cookie. My girlfriend never liked peanut butter cookies until I made him this recipe.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup peanut butter</li>
        <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup shortening</li>
        <li>½ cup margarine, softened</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup quick-cooking oats</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>

        <li>Beat peanut butter, brown sugar, white sugar, shortening, and margarine in a large bowl with an electric

        <li>Combine flour, baking soda, and salt

            until just combined.</li>
        <li>Drop teaspoonfuls of dough onto ungreased cookie sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake cookies in the preheated oven until just lightly browned,
