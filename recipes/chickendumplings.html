    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> I call this rustic because I leave the bones in, which is authentic. 
        But that means you must be careful and make sure not to swallow any!<br> 
        There are so many ways to make this dish, and since our brothers and sisters 
        cook as well our family has several versions.<br> I often ask the meat department 
        or butcher to hand cut a whole chicken into pieces for me 
        (the backbone and wings can be used later to make stock).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 whole chicken, cut into pieces (drumsticks, thighs, and halved breasts)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Morton Natureâ€™s Seasons seasoning blend</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 (32 ounce) carton low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1/2 onion, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon poultry seasoning</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>3 medium carrots, cut into 1-inch pieces (1 1/2 cups)</li>
        <li>3 medium stalks celery, cut into 1-inch pieces (1 1/2 cups)</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups flour, plus more for dusting</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
