    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> call this rustic because I leave the bones in, which is authentic. 
        But that means you must be careful and make sure not to swallow any! 
        There are so many ways to make this dish, and since our brothers and sisters 
        cook as well our family has several versions. I often ask the meat department 
        or butcher to hand cut a whole chicken into pieces for me 
        (the backbone and wings can be used later to make stock).</p>
